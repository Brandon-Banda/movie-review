# Share functionality

---

1. html-to-img, we use this library to capture the div we hard code.

Share functionality completed through the screenshot method. We choose to use react router to render a new page on our site with the image shown and link to the page copied to clipboard.

Things we can do:

- [ ] Popup that says copied to clickboard onclick
- [ ] Auto open new tab on click
- [ ] Add filters to html-to-img so that we can have a cleaner picture
- [ ] Add a functionality to where we can select more than 5 movies, whether that be pagination or adding/removing movies.
- [ ] Improve Navbar
- [ ] Write onClick handlers for + and - buttons

var list = []; list.push({ date: '12/1/2011', reading: 3, id: 20055 });

need to track the button ids of each row so i can add and remove properly
