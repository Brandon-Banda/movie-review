Abstract:
movie-review is a React.js website deployed with Firebase. At its core, it is an IMDB clone, with the vision of providing a way for people to compare their opinion of movies by rating 1-5 Stars. It would work similarly to "Tiermaker", a very popular site that allows users to share how they tier things from certain topics.

**Product Backlog**:

- [x] As a User, I want to rate a movie.
- [x] As a User, I want to rate a varied selection of movies.
- [x] As a User, I want to share my ratings with other users.
- [x] As a User, I want to see pictures of the movies i'm rating.
- [x] As a User, I want a summary of the movies i'm going to rate, in case I don't remember fully.
- [x] As a User, I would like to expand the thumbnail for viewing purposes.

- [ ] Possibly in a future version, we can grab images and other data from a movie db using API calls, saving us time and expanding our products reach

- [ ] Incorporate pagination so we can have more than just 5 options to rate, and instead have 5 options per page

- [ ] Share capability using Redux for state managment of rating

- [ ] Hyperlink the titles with links to Imdb descriptions

- [ ] Change functionality to rate by clicking a singular star, it expands to 5, clicking the value, it condenses to one star again, but displaying ("value") beside it

### Sprint #1 (3/15-3/18) "5 Star Functionality" -

**Sprint Data**:
Sprint Planning Meeting: 3/15 Adrian provided the Product Backlog, and we created our Sprint #1's Sprint Backlog.

**Sprint Backlog**:

- [x] Our main focus for this sprint is to design a 5 star functionality to later implement to movies.

### Work done

Logic behind getting 5 stars inline with a mouseclick input

**Max Clarke - Software Engineer:**

Finding the package to use (Searched for icons to use for our rating system npm install react-icons)

Logic behind coloring in the stars Yellow or Grey depending on which star we've clicked

We gave ourselves a small homework on git to familiarize ourselvs with git collaboration for the future development.
